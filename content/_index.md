# I'm Romain, nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer from Lille, France with a decade of experience building robust, scalable systems from the ground up. My career spans from low-level system programming to modern microservices architectures, with a consistent focus on crafting elegant solutions performing at scale.

Currently serving as a Golang Back-end Engineer, I design and implement APIs within microservices ecosystems while mentoring development teams. My technical foundation in C and system-level programming gives me a unique perspective on performance optimization and architectural decisions.

While others might be satisfied with *good enough* solutions, I always strive for simplicity. I believe it is a defining characteristic of expertise. This philosophy has consistently delivered systems that are not just functional, but performant, maintainable and pleasant to work with.
